  "summary": "Fixed Filament assets loading issue by publishing assets using 'php artisan filament:assets' command. All CSS and JS files for Filament admin panel are now available in public directory. Cleared all caches (config, routes, views, filament) to ensure changes take effect. Assets are now accessible at /css/filament/* and /js/filament/* paths.",
  "current_status": "Filament assets successfully published. All CSS and JS files are now in public directory. User should refresh the browser (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R) to see the changes. The 404 errors for Filament assets should be resolved. Alpine.js errors about undefined variables (sidebar, table, etc.) should also be fixed once assets load properly."
