  "summary": "Fixed GeneralSettings page 500 error by creating GeneralSettingsSeeder to initialize default settings in database. Updated GeneralSettings class to have default values for nullable properties. Also fixed mount() method in GeneralSettings page to handle MissingSettings exception gracefully. The Vite connection error on port 6365 is expected in production - Vite dev server is not running, which is normal for production builds.",
  "current_status": "GeneralSettings seeder created and executed successfully. Settings are now initialized in database. The page should load without 500 error. Vite connection error is expected when dev server is not running - this is normal and assets should be built for production. User should refresh the page to see GeneralSettings working."
