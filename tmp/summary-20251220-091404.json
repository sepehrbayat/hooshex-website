  "summary": "Verified AI Bot section layout fix implementation. Confirmed that order classes are correctly applied: Pink Form (line 172) has order-1 md:order-1 lg:order-1 (appears first on mobile/tablet), and Glass Card (line 237) has order-2 md:order-2 lg:order-2 (appears second on mobile/tablet). Verified z-index values are maintained (Glass: z-30, Form: z-10), and liquid-glass CSS styles are unchanged with no responsive modifications. Container structure uses flex flex-col which properly supports order property for mobile/tablet layouts while desktop uses absolute positioning.",
  "current_status": "All verification tasks completed. The layout fix has been correctly implemented according to documentation. Mobile/tablet will display pink form above glass card, while desktop layout remains unchanged with absolute positioning. No code changes needed - implementation matches requirements."
