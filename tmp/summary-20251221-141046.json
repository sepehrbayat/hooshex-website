  "summary": "Completed Phase 1 (Deep Media Integration - Curator) and Phase 2 (Navigation System). Phase 1: Created migration to add *_id foreign keys to ai_tools (logo_id), courses (thumbnail_id), posts (thumbnail_id), news (thumbnail_id), products (thumbnail_id), teachers (avatar_id). Updated all 6 models to add BelongsTo relationships to Curator Media. Replaced FileUpload with CuratorPicker in all Filament Resources (AiTool, Course, Post, News, Product, Teacher). Phase 2: NavigationItem model and Resource already existed. Updated layout.blade.php to use dynamic $headerMenu from ViewComposer. Footer navigation can be updated similarly when needed.",
  "current_status": "Phase 1 and Phase 2 complete. All models now support both old *_path fields (for backward compatibility) and new *_id fields (Curator Media). Filament Resources use CuratorPicker. Navigation system integrated into header. Ready for migration execution."
