  "summary": "Fixed blog section alignment issues. The problem was using justify-end and padding-right in RTL context which caused left alignment. Changed title justify-content from flex-end to flex-start (right in RTL), changed metadata justify-content from justify-end to justify-start (right in RTL), and changed padding from padding-right to padding-left (proper RTL spacing). Badge positioning remains correct at left: 229px. All blog cards now have proper right alignment in RTL context.",
  "current_status": "Blog section alignment fixed. All titles, metadata, and badges are now properly right-aligned in RTL context. The section uses correct RTL flexbox properties: justify-start for right alignment, padding-left for proper spacing. All four blog cards display correctly with right-aligned content."
