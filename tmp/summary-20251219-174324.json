  "summary": "Fixed RTL alignment in footer: changed Content Container inside About Us from items-end to items-start (in RTL, items-start = right). All other alignments remain: About Us column uses items-end (right), Useful Links & Popular Courses use items-end (right), Trust Badges use justify-end (right), Social Icons use justify-end (right), Copyright uses justify-start (left). Applied correct RTL rules: in RTL, items-start = right, items-end = left, justify-start = right, justify-end = left (opposite of LTR).",
  "current_status": "Footer RTL alignment corrected. Content Container inside About Us now uses items-start for right alignment. Ready for browser verification to confirm all elements are correctly positioned."
