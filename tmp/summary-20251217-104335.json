Found existing extracted CSS files (desktop-figma.css, mobile-figma.css, tablet-figma.css) with complete design specifications. Also discovered existing homepage implementation in resources/views/livewire/home.blade.php with all major sections (Hero, Features, Career Paths, Super App, Courses, AI Bot, Instagram, Testimonials, Blog, Contact, Banner). Next steps: Either troubleshoot Figma MCP connection or refine existing implementation using extracted CSS files to achieve pixel-perfect accuracy.",
