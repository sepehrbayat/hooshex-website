Updated all references across the codebase (15+ files including Models, Policies, Controllers, Filament Resources, Seeders, Factories). Deleted old model files. Started Phase 1.2: Created 3 Action classes following Single Responsibility Principle: EnrollUserAction, AddProductToCartAction, CreateOrderFromCartAction. No linting errors. Configuration cache cleared.",
