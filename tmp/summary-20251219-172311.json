  "summary": "Added background image to banner section. Used image-23.png as placeholder background image with absolute positioning, opacity 30%, and gradient overlay (from-[#5537ea]/80 via-[#eb55c8]/80 to-[#775fee]/80) for better text readability. Content container has relative z-10 to appear above background. Image covers entire container with object-cover. Note: If image-23.png is not the correct banner background image from Figma, the correct image needs to be exported from Figma and saved to public/figma-images/images/ directory.",
  "current_status": "Banner section now has background image overlay with gradient. Structure is ready - if the image file (image-23.png) is not correct, need to export the correct banner background image from Figma and update the src path."
