  "summary": "Created comprehensive admin access control system. Added role field to users table via migration, updated User model with UserRole enum cast and helper methods (isAdmin, isTeacher, isStudent), created EnsureUserIsAdmin middleware, registered admin Gate in AuthServiceProvider, configured Filament AdminPanelProvider to use admin middleware, updated AdminUserSeeder to set admin role, and registered middleware alias in bootstrap/app.php. The system now restricts Filament admin panel access to users with admin role only.",

Users without admin role will receive 403 error when trying to access /admin routes. Ready for testing - login with admin credentials to verify access control."
