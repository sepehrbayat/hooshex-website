  "summary": "Fixed TypeError in GeneralSettings page by correcting the settings table structure. The original migration had 'key' and 'value' columns, but Spatie Laravel Settings requires 'name' and 'payload' columns. Created a migration to fix the table structure, updated GeneralSettingsSeeder to use correct column names and JSON encoding for payload, and cleared settings cache. The page should now load without errors.",
  "current_status": "Settings table structure fixed to match Spatie Laravel Settings requirements (name/payload instead of key/value). Seeder updated to properly encode values as JSON payload. Settings cache cleared. GeneralSettings page should now work correctly without TypeError."
