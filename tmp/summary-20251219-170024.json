  "summary": "Fixed blog section metadata alignment issue. The problem was that icons (calendar icon and dot separator) appeared on the left side of text in RTL layout. Solution: Reordered HTML elements so Calendar Icon comes first in HTML, which makes it appear on the right side in RTL (since RTL flows right-to-left). Final order: Calendar Icon (right) → Date → Dot Separator → Reading Time (left). Also cleaned up debug logging code from app.blade.php.",
  "current_status": "Blog section metadata is now correctly aligned in RTL. Icons appear on the right side of text as expected. All four blog cards have consistent alignment. Debug instrumentation removed. All styles are working correctly with Vite dev server running."
