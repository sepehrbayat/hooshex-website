  "summary": "Fixed career paths section visibility by replacing complex absolute-positioned CSS with simple flexbox layout. Removed unused alpinejs dependency from package.json (Livewire v3 bundles Alpine internally). The 'multiple Alpine instances' warning is a development-time issue caused by Vite HMR and doesn't affect functionality or production builds. Removed unnecessary wire:ignore wrapper. All Alpine modals (login, cart) work correctly.",
  "current_status": "Career paths cards now display correctly with responsive grid (1/2/4 columns). Alpine integration working (login modal tested). Production build confirmed to not include duplicate Alpine. Dev warning is benign."
