  "summary": "Fixed the positioning of Group 299 buttons (File Attach + Microphone) in the AI Bot section. The issue was that margin-right was not being applied due to parent flexbox with justify-content: space-between. Solution: Added a specific class 'group-299-buttons' to the element and used transform: translateX(-48px) instead of margin-right. Verified with runtime logs showing transformValue: 'matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, -48, 0)' and hasTransform: true.",
  "current_status": "AI Bot desktop layout fixes completed. All positioning issues resolved: Title above pink box, Interests field in second row, buttons moved up and right, purple squares and title positioned correctly. Transform successfully applied to Group 299 buttons."
