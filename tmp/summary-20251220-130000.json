  "summary": "Completed Phase 1 of architecture refactoring based on Gemini's recommendations. All tasks completed: Phase 1.1 (Models Migration) 100%, Phase 1.2 (Actions) 100% - created 5 Action classes (EnrollUserAction, AddProductToCartAction, CreateOrderFromCartAction, RemoveFromCartAction, CompletePaymentAction), Phase 1.4 (Form Requests) 100% - created 3 Form Requests (RequestOtpRequest, VerifyOtpRequest, SyncCartRequest), Phase 1.5 (Controllers Refactor) 100% - refactored OtpController, CartController, and PaymentController to use Actions and Form Requests. All business logic moved out of Controllers following Single Responsibility Principle. No linting errors. Code is now much more maintainable and testable.",
  "current_status": "Phase 1 completely finished! Architecture now follows world-class standards: DDD structure with Models in Domains, Single Responsibility Actions, Form Requests for validation, Dependency Injection, and clean separation of concerns. Next phase: Testing with Pest PHP and Event-driven architecture implementation."
