  "summary": "Started servers and tested AI Bot section layout in mobile viewport (430px). Built production assets to ensure latest CSS is applied. Verified code implementation: container has flex flex-col, pink form has order-1 md:order-1, glass card has order-2 md:order-2. DOM structure shows form appears before glass card as siblings, which is correct. However, screenshot suggests elements may be displaying side-by-side rather than stacked vertically in mobile. Need to verify if CSS is being applied correctly or if there's a viewport/media query issue.",
  "current_status": "Code implementation is correct according to documentation. Server is running on localhost:6012. Mobile viewport testing shows DOM structure is correct but visual layout needs confirmation. Production build completed successfully. Next step: verify computed CSS styles in browser DevTools to check if flex-col is being applied."
