Extract the complete homepage design from Figma using MCP tools and implement it with 100% pixel-perfect accuracy.

PROCESS:
1. Join Figma channel using mcp_TalkToFigma_join_channel
2. Get document info with mcp_TalkToFigma_get_document_info
3. Read design with mcp_TalkToFigma_read_my_design
4. For each section (Hero, Features, Career Paths, Super App, Courses, AI Bot, Tools, Instagram, Testimonials, Blog, Contact, Banner):
   - Get node info with mcp_TalkToFigma_get_node_info
   - Extract: position (top/left/width/height), colors (exact hex/rgba), typography (size/weight/line-height), spacing (padding/margin/gap), effects (shadows/blur/gradients), border-radius
   - Implement in Blade using Tailwind with EXACT values: w-[758px], h-[592px], bg-[#EB55C8], text-[#22165E], gap-[24px], rounded-[32px], shadow-[0px_2px_8px_rgba(235,85,200,0.46)]

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use exact pixel values from Figma (no approximation)
- Use arbitrary Tailwind values [value] for exact matches
- Match colors exactly (use hex, not theme colors)
- Match typography exactly (size/weight/line-height)
- Match spacing exactly (padding/margin/gap)
- Match all visual effects (glass: bg-[rgba(224,224,224,0.16)], blur: blur-[100.05px], gradients, shadows)
- Maintain RTL layout
- Extract mobile/tablet designs separately for responsive

SPECIAL ATTENTION:
- AI Bot section: glass chatbox at top-[152px], pink form bg-[#EB55C8] at left-[381px], glass inputs bg-[rgba(224,224,224,0.16)]
- All sections: extract and match EVERY detail from Figma

VERIFY:
- Compare rendered output with Figma side-by-side
- Check all sections match pixel-perfect
- Test responsive breakpoints

Output: Complete homepage matching Figma 100% exactly.
